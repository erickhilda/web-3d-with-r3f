<div v-click>

  - Pros:
    - Fast and efficient 3D rendering on the client-side
    - Low-level control over the rendering pipeline
    - Support for advanced 3D features like shaders and textures

  - Cons:
    - Steep learning curve due to low-level API
    - Requires a modern browser with WebGL support
    - More verbose and less declarative than WebGL2

<div v-click>

  - Pros:
    - Large community and many resources available
    - Great for complex scenes and interactions
    - Providing a higher level API for common 3D tasks, making it easier to use than pure WebGL.

  - Cons:
    - Steep learning curve due to large API
    - Requires a modern browser with WebGL support
    - Not as efficient as WebGL2 for simple scenes
